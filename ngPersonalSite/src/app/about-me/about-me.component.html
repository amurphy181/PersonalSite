<h4>Background</h4>
<p>My journey to Colorado started as such life changes often do: I was in the Northeast,
  finding myself in a gray, listless sales gloom wondering what series of poor choices led me
  to that point. The advice I had given to friends and family who found themselves at this point
  - mostly solicited advice, sometimes not - was that they should try their hands at working with
  computers, because they are the way of both the present and future. The glaring disconnect between
  what I had told these other computer-literate folks and what I was willing to do for my own
  future was becoming more apparent by the day, so I started looking into software development
  as a way out of my self-imposed morass.
</p>
<p>And what a relief to have done so. I looked around at a few different places, messing around with
  spreadsheets to determine costs vs. outcomes, what languages were being taught, the size of the classes, basically all of the differentiating information. What really determined my near-term fate, however, was looking into the job listings for programmers and finding out what real employers were looking for in potential candidates. Java topped the list, for both sheer numbers of jobs and level of income, so my search became more focused on those technologies.
</p>
<p>Which, ultimately, led me to the Skill Distillery full-stack Java development bootcamp. After applying and being accepted in the middle of winter, I got to prepping myself on the pre-work and other materials, trying my best to be prepared to start. I was arguably ready for the first two days,but after we blew past the information covered in said pre-work, I was drinking from the proberbial firehose. As the flow of knowledge became more manageable we moved on to SQL databases, JavaScript and Angular-based front-end technologies, and we began to make proper web applications.
</p>
<p>With that in mind, please feel free to check out the GitHub repositories and links to the projects completed during this program. The final project, Moonlight Personal Finance (our team names were generated using a "My Little Pony" random name generator) is the best example of what we were able to produce by the end of the program, though any perusal through the material will show a steady increase in my coding knowledge and proficiency. Enjoy!</p>

<h4>Current State of Affairs</h4>
<p>After all of that learning, I now am working as a Teaching Assistant for Skill Distillery, passing what I learned on to the next cohorts of students and solidifying my own skills as I wrangle my brain around the challenges of explaining still-fresh concepts. Despite these mild challenges - in fact, in large part because of them - the role has turned out to be incredibly suited to my personality type. I had always thought teaching would be up my alley, but never did I anticipate the joy of watching a student suddenly understand a tough concept or make a previously unseen connection to the subject at hand. All in all, it has been a wonderfully productive and satisfying period of my life!</p>
